As Singapore grapples with its hottest months on record, the importance of choosing a home wisely becomes more apparent than ever. With temperatures soaring and the sun beating down relentlessly, the last thing you want is to be trapped in a house that feels like an oven. This is more important than ever with the temperatures projected to rise in Singapore.

The afternoon sun can turn homes that directly faces the afternoon sun into radiators, releasing stored heat long after sunset. This not only makes for uncomfortable living conditions but also results in skyrocketing electricity bills as your aircon struggles to cool your home.

But there's a simple solution, just choose a home that avoids the afternoon sun altogether! Let's look at which are the coolest units of Tanglin Halt Courtyard

# Did you know the sun direction changes each month?
Wait a minute... Before we get there, it's crucial to understand a little about sun direction. Did you know that the sun doesn't always sets true East? The sun angles changes each month due to the Earth's axial tilt and it's orbit around the sun. In one part of the year, the sun appears to move up to 23.5 degrees north of due east, while in the other part of the year, it moves up to 23.5 degrees south of due east. This means that you should be aware of the sun angles at different times of the year when you pick your home!
